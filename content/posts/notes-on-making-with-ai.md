Lately, I've been using Codex a lot to improve this site, often from my phone.

There is something strangely satisfying about shipping tiny upgrades while standing in line, on a train, or in between errands. It makes the whole project feel less like a formal "build" and more like an ongoing conversation with myself.

At the same time, I've been trying to express myself more through content creation with Sora.

I keep circling around the same tension: the fear of being labeled an "AI slop" creator versus the feeling that these tools are still valid creative mediums.

Maybe that label matters. Maybe it doesn't. I don't know yet.

What I do know is that making things still feels personal, even when the process is assisted.

If art is art, maybe the medium is less important than whether something real is being expressed through it.
