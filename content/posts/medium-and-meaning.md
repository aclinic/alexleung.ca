Lately, I've been using Codex a lot to improve this site, often from my phone — fixing a layout bug, tweaking copy, adjusting spacing by a few pixels.

There is something strangely satisfying about shipping tiny upgrades while standing in line, on a train, or in between errands. It makes the whole project feel less like a formal "build" and more like an ongoing conversation with myself.

At the same time, I've been trying to express myself more through content creation with Sora. I'm still learning how to use these tools well; most of what I make feels exploratory rather than polished.

I keep circling around the same tension: the cultural shorthand of “AI slop” and the fear that using these tools somehow disqualifies the work — and the counterpoint that they are simply new creative mediums.

Maybe that label matters. Maybe it doesn't. I don't know yet. What I do know is that the intention is still mine. The judgment, the taste, the direction — those remain with me.

If art is art, perhaps the medium matters less than whether something real is being expressed through it — and whether that expression is intentional.
