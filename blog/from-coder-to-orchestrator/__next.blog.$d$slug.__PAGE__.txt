3:T1100,<p>Over the past two years, my day-to-day work has shifted from direct implementation toward orchestration and verification. In early 2024, I used AI mostly for autocomplete-level tasks such as snippets, error explanations, and small refactors. By 2026, I still write code when needed, but far more of my time goes to defining tasks clearly, checking outputs, and fixing edge cases the agents miss.</p>
<p>This post summarizes what changed, what improved, and what remains unreliable in that transition.</p>

<h2>2024: Useful, but limited</h2>
<p>I started experimenting with <strong>Cline</strong> for straightforward tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>boilerplate,</li>
<li>test scaffolding,</li>
<li>repetitive refactors.</li>
</ul>
<p>I avoided giving it larger tasks for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was easy to get code that looked fine but was wrong in non-obvious ways.</li>
<li>Anything non-trivial took too much prompt back-and-forth.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2025: Better plans, same failure modes</h2>
<p>I switched to <strong>Claude Code</strong> and stopped asking for immediate implementation. Instead, I asked for a plan first and reviewed it.</p>
<p>That improved outcomes, but two problems were persistent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plans were often overbuilt for the actual problem.</li>
<li>The agent would report "done" before handling edge cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the bottleneck moved from writing code to verification.</p>
<h2>Late 2025 onward: what actually helped</h2>
<p>Three changes made this workflow dependable enough for daily use.</p>
<h3>Better model reasoning</h3>
<p>For my use cases, newer models (especially <strong>Opus 4.5</strong>) were noticeably better at keeping constraints in context across longer tasks.</p>
<h3>Better repo context (<code>CLAUDE.md</code>)</h3>
<p>A lot of bad output came from missing context, not missing capability.</p>
<p>I now keep project expectations in <code>CLAUDE.md</code> so every new session starts with the same baseline: architecture preferences, testing requirements, and coding conventions.</p>
<h3>Better execution pattern (Ralph Loop)</h3>
<p>The biggest improvement was switching from one-pass execution to a repeatable loop:</p>
<ol>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Implement</li>
<li>Verify with build/lint/tests</li>
<li>Reflect and continue if needed</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/from-coder-to-orchestrator/ralph-loop.webp" alt="Ralph Loop flow chart showing Plan -> Implement -> Verify -> Reflect"></p>
<h2>Current workflow</h2>
<p>I usually run a planner and an implementer in parallel.</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a short feature brief with constraints and non-goals.</li>
<li>Turn that into checkpoints.</li>
<li>Let the implementer run the loop per checkpoint.</li>
<li>Review design and risk, not just syntax.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example brief:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add Google OAuth using existing <code>AuthService</code>. Store tokens in Redis, not SQL.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Trade-offs</h2>
<p>This workflow is productive, but it has clear costs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> Frequent tool calls and retries add up quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy code friction:</strong> Agents struggle when systems rely on undocumented history.</li>
<li><strong>Personal skill drift:</strong> I type less code directly than I used to.</li>
<li><strong>Attention overhead:</strong> Running multiple agents sounds parallel, but review and coordination still funnel through one person. Human attention is limited, and I still don't have a great system for managing that bottleneck consistently.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What this changes about the job</h2>
<p>The useful part of my work has shifted upward: clearer requirements, tighter constraints, and stronger review discipline.</p>
<p>Implementation still matters, but the highest leverage is in deciding what should be built and verifying whether the output is actually correct.</p>

<p>The biggest open question for me is this: if newer engineers spend less time in low-level debugging, how do they build the judgment needed to review AI-generated changes well?</p>0:{"buildId":"ZPMIQkp1ic2xWQTnOvrH6","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"BreadcrumbList\",\"itemListElement\":[{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":1,\"name\":\"Home\",\"item\":\"https://alexleung.ca/\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":2,\"name\":\"Blog\",\"item\":\"https://alexleung.ca/blog\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":3,\"name\":\"From Writing Code to Orchestrating Agents\",\"item\":\"https://alexleung.ca/blog/from-coder-to-orchestrator\"}]}"}}],["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"BlogPosting\",\"@id\":\"https://alexleung.ca/blog/from-coder-to-orchestrator/#blogposting\",\"url\":\"https://alexleung.ca/blog/from-coder-to-orchestrator/\",\"headline\":\"From Writing Code to Orchestrating Agents\",\"description\":\"How my AI workflow changed from quick snippets to a practical plan/implement/verify loop.\",\"keywords\":\"AI Engineering, Developer Workflow\",\"image\":[\"https://alexleung.ca/assets/blog/from-coder-to-orchestrator/cover.webp\"],\"datePublished\":\"2026-02-03T00:00:00.000Z\",\"dateModified\":\"2026-02-14T00:00:00.000Z\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"@id\":\"https://alexleung.ca/#person\",\"name\":\"Alex Leung\"},\"publisher\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"@id\":\"https://alexleung.ca/#person\"},\"inLanguage\":\"en-CA\",\"mainEntityOfPage\":{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https://alexleung.ca/blog/from-coder-to-orchestrator/\"},\"isPartOf\":{\"@type\":\"Blog\",\"@id\":\"https://alexleung.ca/blog/#blog\",\"name\":\"Blog | Alex Leung\"}}"}}],["$","div",null,{"className":"py-[var(--header-height)]","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"section-title px-4","children":["$","h1",null,{"className":"block w-full text-center","children":"From Writing Code to Orchestrating Agents"}]}],["$","article",null,{"className":"container mx-auto max-w-3xl px-5 mb-12","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"surface-static p-4 mx-auto","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-3 text-lg text-gray-300","children":"February 3, 2026"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6 flex flex-wrap gap-2","children":[["$","span","from-coder-to-orchestrator-AI Engineering",{"className":"inline-flex items-center rounded-full border px-2.5 py-1 text-xs font-semibold inline-flex items-center rounded-full border px-2.5 py-1 text-xs font-semibold border-white/20 text-gray-200","children":"AI Engineering"}],["$","span","from-coder-to-orchestrator-Developer Workflow",{"className":"inline-flex items-center rounded-full border px-2.5 py-1 text-xs font-semibold inline-flex items-center rounded-full border px-2.5 py-1 text-xs font-semibold border-white/20 text-gray-200","children":"Developer Workflow"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"overflow-hidden rounded-lg mb-6 sm:mx-0 md:mb-10","children":["$","$L2",null,{"src":"/assets/blog/from-coder-to-orchestrator/cover.webp","alt":"Cover for From Writing Code to Orchestrating Agents","width":1200,"height":630,"sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 896px, 100vw","priority":false,"className":"aspect-[21/9] w-full object-cover shadow-sm"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose prose-invert max-w-none prose-headings:text-white prose-p:text-gray-300 prose-a:text-accent-link prose-a:no-underline hover:prose-a:text-accent-link-hover hover:prose-a:underline prose-strong:text-white prose-pre:border prose-pre:border-white/10 prose-pre:bg-black/50 md:prose-lg","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$3"}}]]}]}]]}]],["$L4"],"$L5"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
