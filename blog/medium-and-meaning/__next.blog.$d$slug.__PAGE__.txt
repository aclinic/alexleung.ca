7:T49d,<p>Lately, I've been using Codex a lot to improve this site, often from my phone — fixing a layout bug, tweaking copy, adjusting spacing by a few pixels.</p>
<p>There is something strangely satisfying about shipping tiny upgrades while standing in line, on a train, or in between errands. It makes the whole project feel less like a formal "build" and more like an ongoing conversation with myself.</p>
<p>At the same time, I've been trying to express myself more through content creation with Sora. I'm still learning how to use these tools well; most of what I make feels exploratory rather than polished.</p>
<p>I keep circling around the same tension: the cultural shorthand of “AI slop” and the fear that using these tools somehow disqualifies the work — and the counterpoint that they are simply new creative mediums.</p>
<p>Maybe that label matters. Maybe it doesn't. I don't know yet. What I do know is that the intention is still mine. The judgment, the taste, the direction — those remain with me.</p>
<p>If art is art, perhaps the medium matters less than whether something real is being expressed through it — and whether that expression is intentional.</p>3:["$","div",null,{"className":"prose prose-invert max-w-none prose-headings:text-white prose-p:text-gray-300 prose-a:text-accent-link prose-a:no-underline hover:prose-a:text-accent-link-hover hover:prose-a:underline prose-strong:text-white prose-pre:border prose-pre:border-white/10 prose-pre:bg-black/50 md:prose-lg","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$7"}}]
