# Blog Post Tone Skill

Use this skill whenever the user asks to write or edit blog content in Alex's house style.

## Target Voice

- Analytical, structured, and practical.
- Warm but understated: confident, relationship-aware, forward-looking.
- Professional prose with emotional intelligence.
- Avoid theatrics, hype language, and performative emphasis.

## Hard Constraints

1. Do **not** use repeated one-sentence paragraphs as the dominant cadence.
2. Default to cohesive paragraphs that carry one clear claim with supporting detail.
3. Prefer specific trade-offs, mechanisms, and implications over slogans.
4. Keep the writing concise: remove filler, throat-clearing, and redundant qualifiers.

## Drafting Workflow

1. **Frame the thesis** in 1–2 sentences (problem, point of view, scope).
2. **Organize by reasoning** (context → decision/process → trade-offs → takeaway).
3. **Merge choppy lines** into coherent paragraphs unless a list genuinely improves clarity.
4. **Add grounded detail** (examples, constraints, outcomes, caveats).
5. **Tone pass**: replace punchy social-post phrasing with measured professional language.
6. **Cadence pass**: ensure paragraph lengths vary naturally but are mostly multi-sentence.

## Self-Review Checklist

Before finalizing, confirm:

- The piece reads as a cohesive argument, not a thread.
- Paragraphs are mostly multi-sentence and logically connected.
- Claims are backed by context, not just assertion.
- Trade-offs and limitations are explicit.
- The close is forward-looking and concrete.

## Quick Rewrite Patterns

- Convert hook-only opening lines into a thesis + context paragraph.
- Combine adjacent short paragraphs that express one idea.
- Replace broad praise/critique with specific criteria.
- Turn "hot take" phrasing into "observation + evidence + implication."
