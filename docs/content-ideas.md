# Content & Page Ideas Backlog

Purpose: keep a lightweight, maintainable backlog of ideas that extend the site without creating a heavy publishing cadence.

## Status Legend

- **Done**: already implemented on the site
- **Next**: good near-term candidate
- **Later**: useful but non-urgent

## Idea Backlog

Suggested upkeep:

## 3) Digital Bookshelf / Tool Stack — **Next**

A curated resources page with short, high-signal notes.
